## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Carrying out this project was quite trained and helpful to reinforce knowledge. In spite of everything I did not want to make things difficult for myself, so do not try to be as simplistic as possible so as not to write extra code
